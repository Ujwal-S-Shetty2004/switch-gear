      <h1>About the Koenigsegg Jesko</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Engine</h2>
        <p>
          The Jesko features a 5.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, an evolution of the Agera's 5.1-litre engine. It produces 1,280 hp on regular petrol and up to 1,600 hp on E85 biofuel. Key enhancements include a new flat-plane crankshaft, active rubber mounts, and advanced turbochargers with a 20-litre air tank and electric compressor to reduce turbo lag.
          Changes from the Agera's engine include the use of a new 180-degree flat-plane crankshaft that saves 5 kg (11 lb) and increases the redline from 8,250 rpm to 8,500 rpm. The Jesko also utilises active rubber mounts from the Regera that reduce engine vibrations in the cabin. The two large turbochargers are equipped with a 20-litre air tank made from carbon fibre, coupled with an electric compressor which feeds pressurised air to the turbochargers at a pressure of 20 bar (290 psi) in order to reduce turbo lag. The engine has pressure sensors for each cylinder in order to achieve real time cylinder monitoring for the multipoint fuel injection system

        <h2>Transmission</h2>
        <p>
          The engine is mated to an in-house developed 9-speed multi-clutch transmission called the "Light Speed Transmission (LST)". This new transmission weighs 90 kg and is at least 50% shorter in length than the previous 7-speed dual-clutch unit. It allows for seamless gear changes without interruption in power delivery.
